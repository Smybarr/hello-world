# hello-world
This is my first repository. Neato!


My name is Steven and I am currently a graduate-level software engineering student at DePaul University. I am currently learning the ins and outs of Github so that I may use it as a source control tool for my final project in a software development class, but I plan on starting work on some open source projects once my final project is completed. Stay tuned!
